Peer Delivery for VIT Students

Short Description

A hyperlocal peer-to-peer delivery app connecting VIT students across campus. Whether you're craving a burger from One Food but stuck in your hostel bed, or need an iced latte from DC Cafe while you’re in the library – just post your request with a ₹10-20 tip, and fellow students heading that way will deliver it to you while earning pocket money.
